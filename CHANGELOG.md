# Changelog

All notable changes to Kima will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.4] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Vibe embeddings never starting**: `queueVibeEmbeddings` only checked for `NULL` or `'failed'` status, but the `add_vibe_analysis_fields` migration set the column default to `'pending'` — every track was silently skipped forever. Added `'pending'` to the WHERE clause.
- **CLAP infinite retry**: Added `VIBE_MAX_RETRIES` SQL guard to `queueVibeEmbeddings` so permanently-failed tracks (retry count ≥ 3) are never re-queued. Fixed off-by-one: cleanup used `>=` (giving 2 resets) instead of `>` (giving the correct 3).
- **Null byte crash in music scanner**: ASCII control characters in ID3 tags (e.g. embedded null bytes) caused PostgreSQL query failures. `sanitizeTagString()` now strips control chars from title, artist, and album tags before any DB write.
- **Soulseek stuck downloads cycling**: Downloads removed from the active list on timeout or stream error were not removed from `SlskClient.downloads`, causing the slot to be permanently occupied. Added `removeDownload()` and called it in all three error paths (timeout, download stream error, write stream error).
- **Artist enrichment duplicate MBID race condition**: Two artists resolving to the same real MBID simultaneously caused a Prisma `P2002` unique constraint violation, leaving one artist stuck in `processing`. The error is now caught specifically — the duplicate is immediately marked `unresolvable` with a warning log.
- **Admin vibe retry silently skipping tracks**: `POST /vibe/retry` reset `EnrichmentFailure.retryCount` but left `Track.vibeAnalysisRetryCount` at its max value, causing the SQL guard in `queueVibeEmbeddings` to silently skip the track forever. Both counts are now reset together.
- **Preview job missing ownership check**: Spotify preview jobs stored in Redis had no `userId` — any authenticated user could read or consume another user's preview result. `userId` is now stored in the Redis payload and validated on both `GET /preview/:jobId` and `POST /import`.
- **Playlist import DB pool exhaustion**: `matchTrack` inside `startImport` used an unbounded `Promise.all`, saturating the connection pool on large playlists. Wrapped with `pLimit(8)`.
- **PWA safe area double-inset on iOS**: `body` padding and `AuthenticatedLayout` margin both applied `env(safe-area-inset-*)`, doubling the inset gap. Replaced with `--standalone-safe-area-top/bottom` CSS custom properties that default to `0px` in browser mode and are set to the real env values only inside `@media (display-mode: standalone)`. Fixes both the double-inset on iOS PWA and the Vivaldi browser over-inset.
- **Mobile bottom content gap**: Removed the 96px bottom padding (`pb-24`) reserved for the mini player. The player is swipeable so the padding is no longer needed.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **Circuit breaker `circuitOpenedAt` drift**: `failureCount >= CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` stayed true after threshold failures, resetting `circuitOpenedAt` on every subsequent `onFailure()` call — the same rolling-timestamp problem as `lastFailureTime`. Added `&& this.circuitOpenedAt === null` to enforce the single-write invariant.
- **Circuit breaker deadlock**: `shouldAttemptReset()` measured time since last failure, which resets every cleanup cycle, so the 5-minute recovery window never expired. Fixed by recording `circuitOpenedAt` at the moment the breaker first opens and measuring from that fixed point.
- **`recordSuccess()` race condition**: Success detection bracketed only `cleanupStaleProcessing()` — a millisecond window that never captured Python completions (~14s batch cadence). Replaced with `audioLastCycleCompletedCount` tracked across cycles; `recordSuccess()` fires whenever the completed count grows since the previous cycle.
- **CLAP vibe queue self-heal**: `queueVibeEmbeddings` filtered `vibeAnalysisStatus = 'pending'`, skipping thousands of tracks left as `'completed'` after the `reduce_embedding_dimension` migration dropped their embeddings. Changed filter to `<> 'processing'` so `te.track_id IS NULL` (actual embedding existence) is the source of truth.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **Audio analysis enrichment deadlock**: Three compounding bugs caused enrichment to deadlock after 12+ hours of operation.
  - `runFullEnrichment` reset `analysisStatus` to `pending` without clearing `analysisRetryCount`, silently orphaning tracks the Python analyzer would never pick up (it ignores tracks with `retryCount >= MAX_RETRIES`).
  - `queueAudioAnalysis` had no `retryCount` filter, queuing tracks Python ignores — these timed out and fed false positives to the circuit breaker.
  - The circuit breaker fired on `permanentlyFailedCount > 0`, which is expected cleanup behavior, making it permanently unrecoverable — it reopened immediately on every `HALF_OPEN` attempt.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **SSE streaming through Next.js proxy**: SSE events were buffered by Next.js rewrites, breaking real-time Soulseek search results and download progress in production. Added a dedicated Next.js API route (`app/api/events/route.ts`) that streams SSE responses directly, bypassing the buffering rewrite proxy.
- **CLAP analyzer startup contention**: CLAP model loaded eagerly on container boot (~20s of CPU/memory), competing with the Essentia audio analyzer during startup. Model now loads lazily on first job, which only arrives after audio analysis completes.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **REBRAND**: Project renamed from Lidify to Kima
- Repository moved to `kima-hub` on GitHub
- Docker images now published as `chevron7locked/kima`
- All user-facing references updated across codebase
- First official release under Kima branding
- **Soulseek credential changes**: Settings and onboarding now reset and reconnect Soulseek immediately instead of just disconnecting
- **Soulseek search timeout**: Reduced from 45s to 10s for faster UI response (200+ results stream well within that window)
- **Search result streaming**: Low-quality results (< 128kbps MP3) filtered before streaming to UI, capped at 200 streamed results per search

### Added

- **Album-level Soulseek search**: Discovery downloads use a single album-wide search query with directory grouping and fuzzy title matching, reducing download time from ~15 minutes to ~15-30 seconds
- **SSE-based Soulseek search**: Search results stream to the browser in real-time via Server-Sent Events instead of waiting for the full search to complete
- **Multi-tab audio sync**: BroadcastChannel API prevents multiple browser tabs from playing audio simultaneously -- new tab claims playback, other tabs pause
- **Network error retry**: Audio engine retries on network errors with exponential backoff (2s, 4s) before surfacing the failure
- **Stream eviction notification**: Users see "Playback interrupted -- stream may have been taken by another session" instead of a generic error
- **Stuck discovery batch recovery**: Batches stuck in scanning state are automatically recovered after 10 minutes and force-failed after 30 minutes
- **Stuck Spotify import recovery**: Spotify imports stuck in scanning or downloading states are automatically detected and recovered by the queue cleaner
- **Manual download activity feed**: Soulseek manual downloads now emit `download:complete` events and appear in the activity feed
- **Critical Reliability Fixes**: Eliminated Soulseek connection race conditions with distributed locks
- **100% Webhook Reliability**: Event sourcing with PostgreSQL persistence
- **Download Deduplication**: Database unique constraint prevents duplicate jobs
- **Discovery Batch Locking**: Optimistic locking with version field
- **Redis State Persistence**: Search sessions, blocklists, and cache layer
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Full instrumentation at `/metrics` endpoint
- **Automatic Data Cleanup**: 30-60 day retention policies
- **Database-First Configuration**: Encrypted sensitive credentials with runtime updates
- **Automatic Database Baselining**: Seamless migration for existing databases
- **Complete Type Safety**: Eliminated all `as any` assertions
- **Typed Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with proper HTTP codes

### Fixed

- **Discovery download timeout**: Album-level search eliminates the per-track search overhead (13 tracks x 5 strategies x 15s) that caused 300s acquisition timeouts
- **Worker scheduling starvation**: `setTimeout` rescheduling moved into `finally` blocks so worker cycles always reschedule, even when pile-up guards cause early return
- **Concurrent discovery generation**: Distributed lock (`discover:generate:{userId}`, 30s TTL) prevents duplicate batches when the generate button is clicked rapidly
- **Recovery scan routing**: Fixed source strings (`"discover-weekly-completion"`, `"spotify-import"`) so recovered stuck scans trigger the correct post-scan handlers instead of silently completing
- **Unbounded scan re-queuing**: Added deduplication flags so stuck batches aren't re-queued by the queue cleaner every 30 seconds
- **buildFinalPlaylist idempotency**: Early return guard prevents duplicate playlist generation if the method is called multiple times for the same batch
- **MediaError SSR safety**: Replaced browser-only `MediaError.MEDIA_ERR_NETWORK` with literal value `2` for Next.js server-side rendering compatibility
- **Soulseek search session leak**: Sessions capped at 50 with oldest-eviction to prevent unbounded Map growth
- **Soulseek cooldown Map leak**: Added 5-minute periodic cleanup of expired entries from connection cooldown Maps, cleared on both `disconnect()` and `forceDisconnect()`
- **Unhandled promise rejection**: Wrapped fire-and-forget search `.then()`/`.catch()` handler bodies in try/catch
- **Batch download fault tolerance**: Replaced `Promise.all` with `Promise.allSettled` in album search download phase and per-track batch search/download phases so one failure doesn't abort the entire batch
- **SSE connection establishment**: Added `res.flushHeaders()` and per-message `flush()` calls to ensure SSE data reaches the client immediately through reverse proxies

### Removed

- Debug `console.log` statements from SSE event route and Soulseek search route
- Dead `playback-released` BroadcastChannel broadcast code from audio player
- Animated search background gradient (replaced with cleaner static layout)

### Infrastructure

- Redis-based distributed locking for race condition prevention
- Webhook event store with automatic retry and reconciliation
- Comprehensive type definitions for Lidarr and Soulseek APIs
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key technical choices

## [1.4.3] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Backend unresponsiveness after hours of uptime:** Replaced `setInterval` with self-rescheduling `setTimeout` for the 2-minute reconciliation cycle and 5-minute Lidarr cleanup cycle in `workers/index.ts`. Previously, `setInterval` fired unconditionally every 2/5 minutes regardless of whether the previous cycle had completed. Since `withTimeout()` resolves via `Promise.race` but never cancels the underlying operation, timed-out operations continued running as zombies. Over hours, hundreds of concurrent zombie operations accumulated, starving the event loop and exhausting database connections and network sockets. Each cycle now waits for the previous one to fully complete before scheduling the next, making pile-up impossible.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **GPU acceleration:** CLAP vibe embeddings use GPU when available (NVIDIA Container Toolkit required); MusicCNN stays on CPU where it performs better due to small model size
- **GPU documentation:** README section with install commands for NVIDIA Container Toolkit (Fedora/Nobara/RHEL and Ubuntu/Debian), docker-compose GPU config, and verification steps
- **Model idle unloading:** Both MusicCNN and CLAP analyzers unload ML models after idle timeout, freeing 2-4 GB of RAM when not processing
- **Immediate model unload:** Analyzers detect when all work is complete and unload models immediately instead of waiting for the idle timeout
- **CLAP progress reporting:** Enrichment progress endpoint now includes CLAP processing count and queue length for accurate UI status
- **Discovery similar artists:** Search discover endpoint returns musically similar artists (via Last.fm `getSimilar`) separately from text-match results
- **Alias resolution banner:** UI banner shown when Last.fm resolves an artist name alias (e.g., "of mice" -> "Of Mice & Men")

### Fixed

- **Case-sensitive artist search ([#64](https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/kima-hub/issues/64)):** Added PostgreSQL tsvector search with ILIKE fallback; all artist/album/track searches are now case-insensitive
- **Circuit breaker false trips:** Audio analysis cleanup circuit breaker now counts cleanup runs instead of individual tracks, preventing premature breaker trips on large batches of stale tracks
- **DB reconciliation race condition:** Analyzer marks tracks as `processing` in the database before pushing to Redis queue, preventing the backend from double-queuing the same tracks
- **Enrichment completion detection:** `isFullyComplete` now checks CLAP processing count and queue length, not just completed vs total
- **Search special characters:** `queryToTsquery` strips non-word characters and filters empty terms, preventing PostgreSQL syntax errors on queries like `"&"` or `"..."`
- **NaN pagination limit:** Search endpoints guard against `NaN` limit values from malformed query params
- **Discovery cache key collisions:** Normalized cache keys (lowercase, trimmed, collapsed whitespace) prevent duplicate cache entries for equivalent queries
- **Worker resize pool churn:** Added 5-second debounce to worker count changes from the UI slider, preventing rapid pool destroy/recreate cycles

### Performance

- **malloc_trim memory recovery:** Both analyzers call `malloc_trim(0)` after unloading models, forcing glibc to return freed pages to the OS (6.5 GB active -> 2.0 GB idle)
- **MusicCNN worker pool auto-shutdown:** Worker pool shuts down when no pending work remains, freeing process pool memory without waiting for idle timeout
- **Enrichment queue batch size:** Reduced from 50 to 10 to match analyzer batch size, preventing buildup of stale `processing` tracks
- **Search with tsvector indexes:** Artist, album, and track tables now have generated tsvector columns with GIN indexes for fast full-text search
- **Discovery endpoint parallelized:** Artist search, similar artists, and Deezer image lookups run concurrently instead of sequentially

### Changed

- **Audio streaming range parser:** Replaced Express `res.sendFile()` with custom range parser supporting suffix ranges (`bytes=-N`) and proper 416 responses -- fixes Firefox/Safari streaming issues on large FLAC files
- **Similar artists separation:** Discovery results now split into `results` (text matches) and `similarArtists` (musically similar via Last.fm), replacing the mixed array
- **Last.fm search tightened:** Removed `getSimilarArtists` padding from `searchArtists()` and raised fuzzy match threshold from 50 to 75 to reduce false positives (e.g., "Gothica" matching "Mothica")

### Removed

- Dead enrichment worker (`backend/src/workers/enrichment.ts`) and mood bucket worker (`backend/src/workers/moodBucketWorker.ts`) -- functionality consolidated into unified enrichment worker
- Unused `useDebouncedValue` hook (replaced by `useDebounce` from search hooks)

### Contributors

- @Allram - Soulseek import fix ([#85](https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/kima-hub/pull/85))

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- **Doubled audio stream on next-track:** Fixed race condition where clicking next/previous played two streams simultaneously by making track-change cleanup synchronous and guarding the play/pause effect during loading
- **Soulseek download returns 400 (#101):** Frontend now sends parsed title to the download endpoint; backend derives artist/title from filename when not provided instead of rejecting the request
- **Admin password reset (#97):** Added `ADMIN_RESET_PASSWORD` environment variable support -- set it and restart to reset the admin password, then remove the variable
- **Retry failed audio analysis UI (#79):** Added "Retry Failed Analysis" button in Settings that resets permanently failed tracks back to pending for re-processing
- **Podcast auto-refresh (#81):** Podcasts now automatically refresh during the enrichment cycle (hourly), checking RSS feeds for new episodes without manual intervention
- **Compilation track matching (#70):** Added title-only fallback matching strategy for playlist reconciliation -- when album artist doesn't match (e.g. "Various Artists" compilations), tracks are matched by title with artist similarity scoring
- **Soulseek documentation (#27):** Expanded README with detailed Soulseek integration documentation covering setup, search, download workflow, and limitations
- **Admin route hardening:** Added `requireAdmin` middleware to onboarding config routes and stale job cleanup endpoint
- **2FA userId leak:** Removed userId from 2FA challenge response (information disclosure)
- **Queue bugs:** Fixed cancelJob/refreshJobMatches not persisting state, clear button was no-op, reorder not restarting track, shuffle indices not updating on removeFromQueue
- **Infinite re-render:** Fixed useAlbumData error handling causing infinite re-render loop
- **2FA status not loading:** Fixed AccountSection not loading 2FA status on mount
- **Password change error key mismatch:** Fixed error key mismatch in AccountSection password change handler
- **Discovery polling leak:** Fixed polling never stopping on batch failure
- **Timer leak:** Fixed withTimeout not clearing timer in enrichment worker
- **Audio play rejection:** Fixed unhandled promise rejection on audio.play()
- **Library tab validation:** Added tab parameter validation in library page
- **Onboarding state:** Separated success/error state in onboarding page
- **Audio analysis race condition (#79):** CLAP analyzer was clobbering Essentia's `analysisStatus` field, causing completed tracks to be reset and permanently failed after 3 cycles; both Python analyzers now check for existing embeddings before resetting
- **Enrichment completion check:** `isFullyComplete` now includes CLAP vibe embeddings, not just audio analysis
- **Enrichment UI resilience:** Added `keepPreviousData` and loading/error states to enrichment progress query so the settings block doesn't vanish on failed refetch

### Performance

- **Recommendation N+1 queries:** Eliminated N+1 queries in all 3 recommendation endpoints (60+ queries down to 3-5)
- **Idle worker pool shutdown:** Essentia analyzer shuts down its 8-worker process pool (~5.6 GB) after idle period, lazily restarts when work arrives

### Changed

- **Shared utility consolidation:** Replaced 10 inline `formatDuration` copies with shared `formatTime`/`formatDuration`, extracted `formatNumber` to shared utility, consolidated inline Fisher-Yates shuffle with shared `shuffleArray`
- **Player hook extraction:** Extracted shared `useMediaInfo` hook, eliminating ~120 lines of duplicated media info logic across MiniPlayer, FullPlayer, and OverlayPlayer
- **Preview hook consolidation:** Consolidated artist/album preview hooks into shared `useTrackPreview`
- **Redundant logging cleanup:** Removed console.error calls redundant with toast notifications or re-thrown errors

### Removed

- Dead player files: VibeOverlay, VibeGraph, VibeOverlayContainer, enhanced-vibe-test page
- Dead code: trackEnrichment.ts, discover/types/index.ts, unused artist barrel file
- Unused exports: `playTrack` from useLibraryActions, `useTrackDisplayData`/`TrackDisplayData` from useMetadataDisplay
- Unused `streamLimiter` middleware
- Deprecated `radiosByGenre` from browse API (Deezer radio requires account; internal library radio used instead)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-05

### Performance

- **Sequential audio/vibe enrichment:** Vibe phase skips when audio analysis is still running, preventing concurrent CPU-intensive Python analyzers from competing for resources
- **Faster enrichment cycles:** Reduced cycle interval from 30s to 5s; the rate limiter already handles API throttling, making the extra delay redundant
- **GPU auto-detection (CLAP):** PyTorch-based CLAP vibe embeddings auto-detect and use GPU when available, falling back to CPU
- **GPU auto-detection (Essentia):** TensorFlow-based audio analysis detects GPU with memory growth enabled, with device logging on startup

### Changed

- **Enrichment orchestration simplified:** Replaced 4 phase functions with duplicated stop/pause handling with a generic `runPhase()` executor and `shouldHaltCycle()` helper

### Fixed

- **Docker frontend routing:** Fixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` build-time env var in Dockerfile so the frontend correctly proxies API requests to the backend
- **Next.js rewrite proxy:** Updated rewrite config to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` for consistent build-time/runtime behavior
- **False lite mode on startup:** Feature detection now checks for analyzer scripts on disk, preventing false "lite mode" display before analyzers send their first heartbeat
- **Removed playback error banner:** Removed the red error bar from all player components (FullPlayer, MiniPlayer, OverlayPlayer) that displayed raw Howler.js error codes
- **Enrichment failure notifications:** Replaced aggressive per-cycle error banner with a single notification through the notification system when enrichment completes with failures

## [1.3.9] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed

- **Audio analysis cleanup:** Fixed race condition in audio analysis cleanup that could reset tracks still being processed

## [1.3.8] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Enrichment:** CLAP queue and failure cleanup fixes for enrichment debug mode

## [1.3.7] - 2026-02-01

- TODO: Re-enable in v1.4 with proper CSS fix (`flex-1 flex flex-col min-h-0`)

## [1.3.1] - 2025-01-07

### Fixed
- Production database schema mismatch causing SystemSettings endpoints to fail
- Added missing `downloadSource` and `primaryFailureFallback` columns to SystemSettings table

### Database Migrations
- `20260107000000_add_download_source_columns` - Idempotent migration adds missing columns with defaults

### Technical Details
- Root cause: Migration gap between squashed init migration and production database setup
- Uses PostgreSQL IF NOT EXISTS pattern for safe deployment across all environments
- Default values: `downloadSource='soulseek'`, `primaryFailureFallback='none'`

### Changed

- Audio analyzer default workers reduced from auto-scale to 2 (memory conservative)
- Audio analyzer Docker memory limits: 6GB limit, 2GB reservation
- Download status polling intervals: 5s (active) / 10s (idle) / 30s (none), previously 15s
- Library pagination options changed to 24/40/80/200 (divisible by 8-column grid)
- Lidarr download failure detection now has 90-second grace period (3 checks)
- Lidarr catalog population timeout increased from 45s to 60s
- Download notifications now use API-driven state instead of local pending state
- Enrichment stop button now gracefully finishes current item before stopping
- Per-album enrichment triggers immediately instead of waiting for batch completion
- Lidarr edition variant detection now proactive (enables `anyReleaseOk` before first search)
- Discovery system now uses AcquisitionService for unified album/track acquisition
- Podcast and audiobook time display now shows time remaining instead of total duration
- Edition variant albums automatically fall back to base title search when edition-specific search fails
- Stale pending downloads cleaned up after 2 minutes (was indefinite)
- Download source detection now prioritizes actual service availability over user preference

### Removed

- Artist delete buttons hidden on mobile to prevent accidental deletion
- Audio analyzer models volume mount (shadowed built-in models)

### Database Migrations Required

```bash
# Run Prisma migrations
cd backend
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**New Schema Fields:**

- `Album.originalYear` - Stores original release year (separate from remaster dates)
- `SystemSettings.enrichmentConcurrency` - User-configurable enrichment speed (1-5)
- `SystemSettings.downloadSource` - Primary download source selection
- `SystemSettings.primaryFailureFallback` - Fallback behavior on primary source failure
- `SystemSettings.lidarrWebhookSecret` - Shared secret for Lidarr webhook signature verification
- `User.tokenVersion` - Version number for JWT token invalidation on password change
- `DownloadJob.targetMbid` - Index added for improved query performance

**Backfill Script (Optional):**

```bash
# Backfill originalYear for existing albums
cd backend
npx ts-node scripts/backfill-original-year.ts
```

### Breaking Changes

- None - All changes are backward compatible

### Security

- **Critical:** Bull Board admin dashboard now requires authenticated admin user
- **Critical:** Lidarr webhooks verify signature/secret before processing requests
- **Critical:** Encryption key validation on startup prevents insecure defaults
- Session cookies use secure settings in production (httpOnly, sameSite=strict, secure)
- Swagger API documentation requires authentication in production (unless `DOCS_PUBLIC=true`)
- JWT tokens have proper expiration (24h access, 30d refresh) with refresh token support
- Password changes invalidate all existing tokens via tokenVersion increment
- Transaction-based download job creation prevents race conditions
- Enrichment stop control no longer bypassed by worker state
- Download queue webhook handlers use Serializable isolation transactions
- Webhook race conditions protected with exponential backoff retry logic

## Release Notes

When deploying this update:

1. **Backup your database** before running migrations
2. **Set required environment variable** (if not already set):
   ```bash
   # Generate secure encryption key
   SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
   ```
3. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` in the backend directory
4. Optionally run the originalYear backfill script for era mix accuracy:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx ts-node scripts/backfill-original-year.ts
   ```
5. Clear Docker volumes for audio-analyzer if experiencing model issues:
   ```bash
   docker volume rm lidify_audio_analyzer_models 2>/dev/null || true
   docker compose build audio-analyzer --no-cache
   ```
6. Review Settings > Downloads for new multi-source download options
7. Review Settings > Cache for new enrichment speed control
8. Configure Lidarr webhook secret in Settings for webhook signature verification (recommended)
9. Review Settings > Security for JWT token settings

### Known Issues

- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in spotifyImport.ts matchTrack method (unrelated to this release)
- Simon & Garfunkel artist name may be truncated due to short second part (edge case, not blocking)
